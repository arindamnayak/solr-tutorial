The fact is most will have to deal with legacy applications for some time to come. And to complicate matters further, typical business processes transcend multiple heterogeneous applications making them difficult to automate. In this course we look at how to use BizTalk Server (BTS) to bridge such integration gaps and simplify business process automation. By combining the connectivity provided by its messaging engine with the productivity provided by its orchestration engine, BizTalk Server can help you tackle tough business process scenarios in your connected systems today.",Live,no,Matt Milner,web-services biztalk microsoft distributed-systems developer web-services biztalk microsoft distributed-systems developer

Once we’ve seen the basics of doing things from scratch, we’ll introduce a JavaScript game engine to help us out as we learn about Quintus and start building our first real complete game. From there on we’ll expand our game little by little as we add features like moving a player around and firing shots in the game. We’ll also learn how to create enemies in the game and give them some intelligence. So, if you are interested in game development or if you just want to see what is possible with HTML5, check out this course.

But, it doesn’t have to be a painful experience. In this course, I’ll show you the basics of creating an iOS application as we build a complete iOS application learning what we need to know about Objective-C along the way. We’ll start out by learning a little bit about iOS in general and the iOS development environment. Then, we’ll jump right in and create out first Hello World iOS application as we set up our development environment and learn the basics of the IDE we use for iOS development, Xcode. After that, I’ll show you the core things you need to know to build any application, how to build a user interface and interact with it. We’ll learn how to use Xcode’s Interface Builder tool to create a very basic IU and interact with it. Once we’ve got the basics covered, we’ll start building our first real application. We’ll learn a few new concepts as we build our application, like how to use the iOS storyboarding feature to creating a multi-screen application and how to setup navigation in our application. Finally, we’ll finish up our iOS application by learning how to add user settings to the app and how to show the user a simple notification through the use of alerts. So, if you are looking to get started with iOS development and are looking for an easy and gentle way to get introduced to the environment and tools while building a real application, this course is exactly what you need.

Know how to write services in WCF and Web API, but want to see some real-world implementation from both MVC and WPF clients? This course is for you. Want to know how to implement dependency injection from the middle tier to the various UIs? This course is for you. Want to write decoupled, testable software? This course is for you. The final set of applications can be used as a skeleton and framework for any SOA-based system you write going forward, and the techniques used in its development will become part of your development arsenal forever.",Live,no,Miguel Castro,sql mvc wcf twitter-bootstrap wpf moq jquery soa knockout design-patterns mvvm unit-testing web security microsoft asp.net-web-api mef entity-framework developer javascript architecture sql mvc wcf twitter-bootstrap wpf moq jquery soa knockout design-patterns mvvm unit-testing web security microsoft asp.net-web-api mef entity-framework developer javascript architecture

In this course, I’ll take you through the complete process of creating an application that works on each of the platforms and uses a REST based backend API to share data and business logic—all using C#. We’ll start off this course by learning how to build a REST based API using the popular open source framework ServiceStack. I’ll show you how easy it is to get ServiceStack set up and even how to store data for the API using a Redis database. Next, I’ll show you how to create an ASP.NET MVC 4 application that uses the REST service we built to display it's data and implement it's logic. We’ll learn how to use JQuery to make AJAX calls to a REST based API from within our MVC 4 application. Then, we’ll learn how we can use C# and the .NET framework to build an Android application using the Xamarin tools. We’ll use the same REST API, we created earlier and build a real native Android application that is able to consume that API for implementing its logic and displaying data. Finally, I’ll show you how to do the same thing for an iOS application. We’ll again use C# to build a real native iOS application with the Xamarin tools and learn how to consume REST based web services from iOS. So, if you are a C# developer and don’t want to have to learn several other programming languages to build cross platform applications; you’ll definitely want to check out this course. By the end of this course, you’ll have the skills you need to be able to implement an end-to-end cross platform solution complete with a REST based API backend all in C#.",Live,no,John Sonmez,mvc ios xamarin web service-stack android developer mobile mvc ios xamarin web service-stack android developer mobile

And if you are going for a rich, stateful, interactive user experience, you won't want to be doing full page post backs to get that done. To work with the data on the client side, you'll need change tracking and validation of edits, the ability to filter, sort, and page data from the client side. You might need to work with that data offline as well. Breeze.js is a JavaScript library that does all of that for you. Breeze lets you quickly develop a good layered architecture on the client side in JavaScript, acting as a data layer, repository, or data gateway for your client side code. This course will walk you through all of the core features of Breeze. You'll learn how to execute queries from your client side JavaScript to retrieve data for presentation, work with the cached data on the client side, enable rich editing scenarios, handle changes to the data client side, validate that data, and send changes back to the server side.

We'll start off by going over the function of the console, giving you the ability to modify JavaScript objects interactively on the page, debug issues and add helpful log messages with ease. Then, we'll take a trip to the elements panel where we'll be seeing how to modify HTML and CSS styles and see the effects immediately displayed on the page. After that, we'll check out the network panel and how to find out exactly what resources our pages are getting from the network, how long it is taking to get them, and what order all of this is happening in. Then, we'll head over to the sources panel and unveil the powerful built-in JavaScript debugging capabilities that Chrome has out of the box. (You won't want to miss this part.) We'll follow up with a quick review of the audits panel to see how it can give us some handy optimization tips for our pages. Then we'll dig into the timeline panel where we'll learn how to figure out exactly what is happening when a page is being displayed and how to optimize our pages to ensure the animation is never choppy. Finally, we'll wrap things up by seeing how the profiles panel can help us quickly identify performance problems with JavaScript or CSS selectors and also let us see into the scary realm of JavaScript memory management. If you’ve been waiting for the right time to really dig into the Chrome Developer Tools and see what all they can do, that time has come!",Live,no,John Sonmez,debugging chrome google web debugging chrome google web

Applications need to be able to grow without being totally rewritten. Sure, there eventually comes a time when every app needs a major overhaul, but if applications are written to be extensible in the first place, the overhaul can be performed in pieces; and in the meantime, new features can be added or existing features changed without bringing the app down. This ""extensibility"" in our design is becoming more and more important every day as software shops compete with each other for work and even with other countries. There have been many articles and design documents written on things like inversion of control in the UI tiers. Many books have dedicated chapters to injecting objects into MVC controllers or WPF ViewModels, but not many have focused on the meat of a system, the business tiers.

hibernate-introduction,Introduction To Hibernate,14288,2013-07-30T00:00:00Z,"In the world of Java, one of the most popular and widely used frameworks is Hibernate. Hibernate is an ORM, or Object Relational Mapper, that allows developers to map Java objects to relational database tables. It is a valuable tool that all Java developers should know how to use. The problem is, learning Hibernate can be difficult. Hibernate is a very large framework and there are many important concepts to understand to use it effectively. This course is designed to make getting started with Hibernate as easy as possible and focus on the most important things you need to know. We start off this course by learning a bit about Hibernate and how it works, and then see how to get it setup with a real MySQL database installation. After that, we learn the very basics of mapping, which is one of the most important things to understand about Hibernate. I'll show you how to create a basic mapping for a Java object to a relational table and explain to you how the mapping works. But most real world applications have more complex mapping that often trips up new developers and experienced developers alike. So, we'll also cover some of the complex mapping situations like mapping collections and different relational mappings like one-to-many and many-to-one. Once you've learned how to map you objects, you'll want to know how to query them, so I'll show you how to do this using Hibernate's built in HQL and using a more object oriented approach with the Criteria API. Finally, we'll wrap things up by taking a brief tour of some of the more advanced features like caching and interceptors. So, if you are wanting to learn how to use Hibernate, or if you've been struggling through using Hibernate in an existing application, but never really understood what was going on, this course will give you the knowledge you need to feel confident about how Hibernate works and how to use it.",Live,no,John Sonmez,hibernate data object-relational-mapping mysql developer hibernate data object-relational-mapping mysql developer

introduction-building-web-applications-dart,Introduction To Building Web Applications With Dart,9709,2013-06-13T00:00:00Z,"Dart is an exciting new programming language from Google which is designed to eventually replace JavaScript. Dart is an optionally typed language, meaning that it can be as dynamic as JavaScript, but it also has a type system which can give you the benefits of languages like C# and Java. In fact, you'll find that if you already know Java or C#, Dart will seem very familiar to you, since it takes some of the best features of those languages and much of their syntax. Many C# and Java developers find they can start writing Dart code with a very short learning curve. You'll also find that you can start using Dart right now, because Dart code can compile down to standard JavaScript which can run anywhere. In this course, I'll take you through Dart and the Dart platform, and show you the basics of the language. We'll quickly go over the language itself in a single module and then we'll jump right in to building a real web application with Dart and the Dart libraries. You'll learn how to add Dart code to a web page in a very similar fashion that you probably have been doing with JavaScript. You'll also see the power of the Dart language and libraries as we explore some of the advanced data binding and templating features in the Dart Web UI library. We'll wrap up the course by going over some of the advanced features of Dart, like concurrency using isolates instead of threads, and mixins that allow us to get the benefits of inheritance without many of the drawbacks. So, if you've been interested in Dart, but haven't wanted to invest the time into learning a whole new programming language, this course will show you how much about the Dart language you probably already know and get you building a real application quickly. The goal of this course is to make it as easy and painless as possible to get started with Dart and decide if it is something you want to learn more about.",Live,no,John Sonmez,programming-languages google web developer dart javascript programming-languages google web developer dart javascript

Do you have constant battles between the .NET side and the Java side, because of the competition between the two? Perhaps you just have to work in both environments and wish there was a way to reuse some of your code from Java in .NET or .NET code in Java? This course will give you solutions to help with all of those problems. In this course we'll take a look at how you can make your Java and .NET code talk by utilizing 3 different technologies. First, we'll use IKVM.NET to convert Java directly to .NET, which will allow you to use Java libraries in your .NET applications and even write Java applications in .NET. Then, we'll use JNBridgePro to bridge directly between .NET and Java and allow you to communicate between .NET and Java applications while still running each in their own environment. Finally, I'll introduce you to RabbitMQ for creating a message based service that allows for not only Java and .NET to interoperate, but also any other language that can send messages to RabbitMQ. So, if you've been considering rewrite a Java application as a .NET application or a .NET application as a Java application, but have been thinking there has to be a better way, this course might be just what you are looking for. Or if you are in an environment where both Java and .NET are used, but seldom talk to each other, this course can help you to learn about tools you can use to get both sides talking, letting you walk away a hero.",Live,no,John Sonmez,clr programming-languages ikvm rabbitmq java oracle microsoft jnbridge interop developer c# jvm clr programming-languages ikvm rabbitmq java oracle microsoft jnbridge interop developer c# jvm

Unfortunately, since Meteor is so new, there isn’t a large amount of information available to learn how to develop applications with it. This course is designed to take you through the full process of developing a complete single page application in Meteor using JavaScript and deploying that application to a real production system. We’ll start off by learning about what Meteor is and learning about the technologies that Meteor uses. Then, we’ll dig deep into Meteor to demystify the “magic” around it and discover how Meteor is able to do so much with so little code. Then, we’ll actually create our first Meteor application and along the way we’ll cover some of the code concepts of Meteor needed to create a basic Meteor application. Once we have the basics down, we’ll expand our application and discover some of the more advanced concepts of the platform that really allows us to utilize the power of Meteor. Finally, we’ll go beyond Meteor as we learn how to deploy our application to both the Meteor servers and a Linux machine in the cloud and also discover how to use community created extensions to do things like add routing to our application.

We first look at how the shift in technology trends established the need for a different breed of technologies. Columnar, or Column-Oriented, databases have become increasingly popular in data warehousing applications because they allow for better compression and multi-fold performance improvements, and we'll see how SQL Server 2014 implements this with clustered columnstore indexes. In addition, as technology makes a bigger shift in hardware to multi-core CPU architectures and large amounts of memory are even cheaper and more attainable, it's important for software to adjust and utilize these changes. We'll see how In-Memory OLTP addresses these trends and more, letting you create tables in memory, eliminating locks and implementing optimistic multi-version concurrency. This course discusses in depth In-Memory OLTP (memory optimized tables), previously known as Hekaton. We'll cover creating memory-optimized tables, loading data, durability and the affect that has on the transaction log. We'll also look at indexing in detail, explaining the new index types created specifically to support In-Memory OLTP and how and when to apply each type based on your use case and we'll discuss how In-Memory OLTP and Clustered Columnstore indexes can fit a variety of applications while comparing them with each other and traditional disk-based tables and indexes.",Live,no,Ahmad Alkilani,sql data admin microsoft data-warehousing developer sql-server sql data admin microsoft data-warehousing developer sql-server

In this live session, we asked him to design a mobile UI for a theoretical trail hiking directions application. Neven shows that experienced designers and developers go far beyond merely learning the latest software APIs or using the newest features of hardware. He applies his skills of analysis toward understanding the task, then finds relevant language to communicate the direction in which he wants to take it. Neven is not only a skilled designer, he's also an eloquent teacher. In about an hour and 45 minutes, you'll hear him talk through his design process and explain the decisions he makes along the way.",None,no,Neven Mrgan,ui-design ui-design designer designer peepcode peepcode playbyplay playbyplay open-source open-source developer developer mobile mobile ui-design ui-design designer designer peepcode peepcode playbyplay playbyplay open-source open-source developer developer mobile mobile

Most often many different people, with different skills work together to build the solution. It is not uncommon to have the technology not be the most challenging part of the project, but rather it is often the lack of clear communication between the project team members. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) helps the team members to communicate clearly and precisely. The UML includes several diagrams and models that support the design of different aspects of the solution. If each member of the team is able to understand those models that are useful to them they are more likely to understand each other, and the challenges and risks of different understandings and views of the solution are minimized. In this course we review the need for this clear communication. We discuss several of the common diagrams that teams use to model a software solution and identify some of the team members that most commonly use the diagram. The UML is very large and there is much that can be done with it beyond what is covered in this introductory course.

wpf-data-binding-in-depth,WPF Data Binding in Depth,22760,2014-01-09T00:00:00Z,"The data binding capabilities of WPF are one of the most powerful parts of the XAML platform. Data binding allows you to keep your XAML UI definition loosely coupled from the logic and data access that gets data into the application that will be used for display purposes. You can use data binding to build rich, interactive, beautifully designed user interfaces that are driven by data of many types. In this course you will learn how to leverage all the features of data binding and will learn enough to feel comfortable tackling everything from simple to complex data binding scenarios. You'll learn about what kinds of data sources you can work with, all the features that the Bindings themselves support, and how to use DataTemplates to provide a custom, reusable XAML rendering of your data objects. You'll learn how to use design time features in Visual Studio to generate data bound UIs or hook up existing ones, and you'll learn how to use the validation features to validate input data and present errors to the user. Along the way, you'll see some demos that use the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern and others that do not so you can see the power of data binding regardless of the UI patterns that you follow.",Live,no,Brian Noyes,desktop wpf data microsoft developer desktop wpf data microsoft developer
